Spring Boot REST API(Kotlin) for nutritive application. It includes JWT-based authentication (login/signup), features like creating a new product(if it doesn't exist), saving an existing product for future reference, endpoints for creating, updating, reading or deleting allergens, categories, tags, additives, countries, products and nutriments.

üîî Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Integration

The project integrates with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver real-time push notifications to client devices.

Service: FcmService

The FcmService is responsible for sending notifications to user devices using their device tokens. It authenticates against Google APIs using a service account and obtains an OAuth2 access token to send messages securely.

Key Features

Send Notifications

sendNotification(targetToken, title, body)
Sends a generic push notification to a given device token.

Send Allergen Alerts

sendAllergenAlert(deviceToken, productName, allergens)
Specialized method for warning users if a product they scanned or selected contains allergens.
Example push notification:

‚ö†Ô∏è Allergen Alert
Product Snickers contains: peanuts, lactose


Authentication
Uses GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault() with the scope
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging
to obtain a valid Bearer token before sending requests.

HTTP Client
Uses OkHttpClient to post requests to the FCM REST endpoint:

https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/nutritiveapp/messages:send

Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability:

Domain Layer
Contains core business logic and models.
Independent of frameworks, databases, or external services.

Application Layer
Coordinates use cases.
Defines service interfaces and orchestrates workflows.

Infrastructure Layer
Provides implementations for database access (PostgreSQL), messaging (FCM), and integrations with AWS services (S3, RDS).

Presentation Layer
Exposes REST API endpoints to clients (the Android application).

Dependency Injection

The project leverages Spring Boot‚Äôs built-in Dependency Injection (DI).
All services, repositories, and controllers are managed as Spring beans.
This allows easy mocking in tests and clean separation of concerns.
